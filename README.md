## The Space Station Website
This was the first project on the CSS and Bootstrap course, it was created after following a series of tutorial videos in which we first created the HTML structure of the site during the HTML course. Then during the CSS course we re-visited the site and used CSS to add styling to the site, in which we added features such as a navbar, image containers and forms.

## One-page Website - Gaming Blog
For the second project on this course we revisted the one-page website we made during the HTML course, the theme for site was a simple gaming blog, I used the game I was playing at the time 'Triangle Strategy' as the game in question and captuerd my own screenshots for the project. The site again started as a simple HTML site then we re-visted the site and used CSS to add styling to the site and used containers for both images and video, a contact form so the user can sign up to the blog and created a navbar that stays at the top of the page even when scrolling down the page.

## Bootstrap Project Website - Hobby Blog
The third project on the CSS and Bootstrap course was to use bootstrap to make a website so I revisted the blog theme from the one-page website and created a general hobby blog to use as a theme, so in addition to games I also include the books I am reading. This entire site was styling using bootstrap 5. The site uses many boostrap features such as a navbar, jumbotron, cards and badges.

## Personal Portfolio Website - [www.stevenpartlow.com](www.stevenpartlow.com)
The final project for this course was to take all the things we have learned about HTML and CSS and use them to create a personal portfolio website. The site uses a template provided which I then personalised so we can use the site going forward as personsal portfolio for both future job applications and in upcoming courses. The site uses all the features in the prior projects from the course, so a navbar, image containers, contact form connected to formspree.io and CSS to style the text, lists and general site theme, the site also uses video for background, plus hover and animation effects and the site makes uses of the @media tag to adjust the appearance of the site depending on the size of the browser window. The site uses the row and 2x column layout and also makes use of both custom fonts and the font awesome library so that that the navbar can have buttons instead of text, finally the site also contains a section linking to my projects on my github and linkedin.
