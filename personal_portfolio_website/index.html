                    I'm a software developer in training living Ipswich, in the UK. I am currently studying with Pitman Training both at home and on campus, working through the Advanced Software and Web Developer Diploma which is provided by <a href = "https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/">The Tech Academy</a>. When I have finished the course I will be fully trained in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and C# and hoping to work as a software developer. I am also fully trained in Python having completed a <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/">bootcamp</a> on Udemy, and also have BSc in Software Engineering (2.2) from <a href = "https://www.uos.ac.uk/">Suffolk University</a> which I completed in 2001.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently work for the East of England CO-OP and have over 20+ years experience working in the industry. In my spare time I enjoy running, reading and gaming including building gaming PC as hobby so I am fully versed in computer hardware.
